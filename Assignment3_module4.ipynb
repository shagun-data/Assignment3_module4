        "\n",
        "# 1. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "# Generators do not store all values in memory; they produce them one at a time using the yield keyword.\n",
        "# This is especially useful for working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "# Regular Functions, in contrast, often create and store all results in memory, which can lead to high memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Lazy Evaluation (On-Demand Execution)\n",
        "# Generators generate values only when needed. This is called \"lazy evaluation,\" which means computation is\n",
        "# delayed until the value is required.\n",
        "# Regular Functions compute and return all values immediately, even if you don’t need all of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Better Performance for Large or Infinite Sequences\n",
        "# Generators are ideal for infinite or very large sequences because they compute values as you go.\n",

        "# Generators often provide a cleaner and more readable way to implement sequences or iterative processes\n",
        "# compared to regular functions.\n",
        "# Instead of building an entire list, you can use yield to express sequences naturally.\n",
        "\n",
